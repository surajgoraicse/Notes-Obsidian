- Python is not directly compiled into machine code like C or C++. Instead, Python code goes through the following stages:

1.. Source Code:
You write Python code in `.py` files (human-readable).

2.. **Compilation to Bytecode**:
- Python **compiles** the source code into an intermediate representation called **bytecode**.
- Bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent set of instructions stored in `.pyc` files (in the `__pycache__` directory).
- This step happens automatically when you run a Python script.
- **Tools**: The `py_compile` module can explicitly compile `.py` files into `.pyc`.

3.. **Interpretation by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**:
- The **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** reads the bytecode and executes it.
- The PVM is part of the **CPython interpreter**, the most widely used implementation of Python.
