#### What is C ?
C is a general-purpose, procedural, high-level programming language used in the development of computer software and applications, system programming, games, and more.
- C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell labs in 1972.
- It was developed for programming UNIX operating System.

##### What is general-purpose programming language ?
- A **general-purpose programming language** is a type of programming language designed to solve a wide range of problems across different domains, such as web development, system programming, data analysis, and more. 
- These languages are not specialized for any specific task but are versatile and flexible enough for various applications.

##### What is procedural programming language ?
- A procedural programming language is a type of programming language that uses a structured approach to solve problems by dividing them into reusable blocks called procedures or functions.


##### What is a low level programming language ?
- A low-level programming language is a programming language that runs closer to a computer's hardware and machine code.
- It allows programmers to have direct control over the computer's resources and hardware.
##### What is a high level programming language ?
A high-level programming language is a type of programming language that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It abstracts away the details of the computer's hardware and provides a more user-friendly syntax, making it easier to develop software. Examples include Python, Java, and JavaScript.
##### What is a mid level programming language ?
A mid-level programming language is a language that combines features of both high-level and low-level languages. It provides some abstraction from the hardware while still allowing direct access to memory and hardware resources. Mid-level languages offer a balance between ease of use and control over system performance. Examples include **C** and **C++**.
