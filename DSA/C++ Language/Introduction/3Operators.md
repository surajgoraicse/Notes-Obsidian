Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.


#### Types of Operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Ternary or Conditional Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators:
These operators are used to perform arithmetic or mathematical operations on the operands.

| Operator | Description         | Example                     |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition            | `a + b`                     |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `a - b`                     |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `a * b`                     |
| `/`      | Division            | `a / b`                     |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `a % b` (only for integers) |
#### Relational Operators
These compare two values and return a Boolean (`true` or `false`).
