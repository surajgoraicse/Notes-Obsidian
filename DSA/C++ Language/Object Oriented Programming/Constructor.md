- ***Constructor in C++*** Â is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time an object of a class is created. 
- It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally. 
- The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure. 
- It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object which is why it is known as a constructor.
- Constructors are mostly declared in the public section of the class though they can be declared in the private section of the class.
- Constructors do not return values; hence they do not have a return type.
- we can have more than one constructor in a class. It is called Constructor Overloading.

#### Types of constructor:
Constructors can be classified based on in which situations they are being used. There are 4 types of constructors in C++:

1. ***Default Constructor**: No parameters. They are used to create an object with default values.
2. **Parameterized Constructor**: Takes parameters. Used to create an object with specific initial values.
3. **Copy Constructor**: Takes a reference to another object of the same class. Used to create a copy of an object.
4. **Move Constructor**: The move constructor creates the object from an already existing object but by moving it.
