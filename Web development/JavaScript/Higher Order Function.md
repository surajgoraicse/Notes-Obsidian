##### A **higher-order function** is a function that either:
1. **Takes other functions as arguments**, or
2. **Returns a function as its result.**
##### Why Are Higher-Order Functions Useful?
- **Code Reusability:** You can create generic functions that handle a variety of tasks by passing different logic as arguments.
- **Modularity:** Higher-order functions help keep code clean and organized by separating data processing logic from specific implementation.
- **Abstraction:** They abstract common patterns (like iteration or filtering) into reusable functions.
